#summary How to compile H2Sharp

= Introduction =

H2Sharp can be built on all the platforms supported by MonoDevelop.

However so far it seems to work well only on Microsoft .NET (hence, on Windows).

= Prequisites =

  * On Unix / MacOS X : Install [http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page Mono] and [http://monodevelop.com/ MonoDevelop]
  * On Windows : Install the free [http://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/express/aa975050.aspx Visual C# 2008 Express Edition] (not tested yet with [http://www.microsoft.com/express/ 2010])
  * Install [http://www.ikvm.net/ IKVM.NET] and set the IKVM_HOME environment variable to its main directory (should have a 'bin' sub-directory)

= Compiling H2Sharp = 

  * [http://code.google.com/p/h2sharp/source/checkout Checkout H2Sharp]
  * Open h2sharp/H2Sharp/H2Sharp.sln with MonoDevelop or Visual C++ and build

= Updating to a newer version of H2 =

  * Delete `h2sharp/H2Sharp/Dlls/*.jar`
  * Optional: put the version of h2.jar you want in the Dlls directory
  * Run the script `h2sharp/H2Sharp/CreateH2Dll.sh` : it will download the latest h2 JAR and convert all JARs in Dlls to DLL files
  * In Visual C++ or MonoDevelop, update the references to h2-xxx.dll in all the projects so that they point the newly generated h2-yyy.dll
